######  Yield: 16 servings
######  Time:  15 minutes prep, 1 hour chill

##  *Ingredients*
- 1 1/4 cups salsa
- 16 ounce can refried beans
- 2 tablespoons milk
<!--  -->
- 8 ounces cream cheese (softened)
- 1/2 cup sour cream (softened)

<!--  -->
- 1 cup guacamole
- 1 1/2 cups cheddar cheese
- 1/2 cup black olives or tomatoes
- 4 sliced green onions

##  *Directions*
1. Place salsa in a sieve to drain any liquid (this keeps your dip from getting runny).

3. Combine cream cheese, sour cream and taco seasoning with a mixer on medium. Spread over refried beans.

5. Top with cheese, olives/tomatoes and green onions.
6. Chill 1 hour before serving. Serve with tortilla chips or crackers.
