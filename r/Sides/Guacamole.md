# Spencer's Guacamole

##  *Ingredients*
- 2 or 3 ripe Haas avocados
- 1 lime (juiced)
- 1 shallot
- 1 jalape√±o pepper
- 1-2 tablespoons cilantro (chopped, optional)
- Chili powder
- Tabasco sauce
- 1 small red and & tasty Roma tomato (chopped into small chunks)
- Kosher salt to taste

##  *Directions*
1. Smash the avocados into a chunky cream by hand with a fork (you don't want it blended smooth!)
2. Mix in the rest of the ingredients, using the fork to stir in evenly
3. Add salt to taste
4. Do a taste-test with some tortilla chips & adjust as necessary...more lime juice, more Tabasco, more chili powder. You'll know when you've hit the right combination of flavors because all of a sudden you'll be like "oh man, that's good" & can't stop sampling it, so that's the tipping point you're looking for
