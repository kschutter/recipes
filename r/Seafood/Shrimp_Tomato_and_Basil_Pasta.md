######  Yield: 4 servings
######  Time:  30 minutes

##  *Ingredients*
- 1 1/2 pounds medium shrimp peeled and deveined (tails removed)
- 6 teaspoons olive oil
<!--  -->
- 2 garlic cloves (minced)
- 1 (14.5 ounces) can diced tomatoes in juice
- 1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes (halved)
<!--  -->
- 1/2 pound linguine
- 1 1/2 cups lightly packed fresh basil leaves torn into small pieces, plus extra leaves for garnish (optional)

##  *Directions*
1. Season shrimp with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat 4 teaspoons oil over high. Add shrimp; cook until opaque throughout, turning occasionally, 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl; set aside.
2. To the same skillet, add remaining 2 teaspoons oil and garlic; cook over medium heat until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add canned tomatoes and their juice, along with 2 cups water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes have softened and are saucy, about 15 minutes. Remove sauce from heat; stir in cherry tomatoes.
3. Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta until al dente, according to package instructions. Drain; return pasta to pot. Add tomato sauce, shrimp, and basil; season with salt and pepper, and toss. Serve immediately, garnished with basil leaves, if desired.
