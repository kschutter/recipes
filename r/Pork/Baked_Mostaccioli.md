# Baked Mostaccioli

######  Yield: 8 servings
######  Time:  45 minutes

##  *Ingredients*
- 1 pound mostaccioli pasta
<!--  -->
- 1 lb mild or hot Italian sausage
- 1 large onion (diced)
- 4 cloves garlic (minced)
<!--  -->
- 1 jar (25.5 oz) pasta sauce
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese


##  *Directions*
1. Start cooking the noodles according to instructions.
2. Preheat oven to 350F. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the Italian sausage until cooked through, about 10 minutes. Add in the onion and garlic, and cook until just tender and translucent, about 3 minutes. Make sure to scrape up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan. 
3. In a large mixing bowl, stir together the Italian sausage mixture, cooked pasta and pasta sauce until well combined. 
4. Layer half of the pasta mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish and top with half of the mozzarella cheese and half of the Parmesan cheese. Spoon the remaining pasta mixture into the dish to form a second layer. 
5. Top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.
6. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is brown and bubbly. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh parsley, if desired.
