# Italian Sausage Sandwiches

######  Yield: 4 servings
######  Time:  5 minute prep, 30 minute cook; 35 minutes total

##  *Ingredients*
- 16 ounces (4 links) italian sausage links
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 1 cup water
<!--  -->
- 1 medium onion (sliced thin)
<!--  -->
- 1 cup marinara sauce
- 1 cup mozzarella cheese (grated)
- 4 sub or hoagie rolls
- chopped parsley (for garnish, optional)

##  *Directions*
### Cook the Italian Sausage
1. Heat the oil in a large, non-stick skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the sausage. Cook the sausage for 4-6 minutes, turning them occasionally to brown on all sides.
2. Carefully add the water to the skillet and cover.
3. Cook the sausages for 15-20 minutes until most of the liquid has cooked out and the internal temperature reaches at least 165F.
4. Take the skillet off the heat and remove the sausages, place on a pan or plate and loosely cover with foil to keep warm.
### Cook the Onions
1. If there is any liquid left in the skillet drain it off, but do not wash. There should be a layer of oil, if there’s not, add one teaspoon.
2. Heat the skillet on medium. When the skillet is hot, add the onions. Cook them gently for 5-7 minutes until golden, stirring frequently. Remove the skillet from the heat.
3. While the onions cook, move the oven rack to the bottom third of the oven and set it to the low broil setting.
### Build the Sandwiches
1. Cut each sub/hoagie roll to roughly the size of the cooked sausage. Then cut the bread in half lengthwise, but don’t go all the way through.
2. Add two tablespoons of the marinara sauce to the bottom piece of the roll and sprinkle with about 2 tablespoons of mozzarella cheese.
3. Add one sausage to each roll and top each with two tablespoons of marinara sauce, cooked onions and 2 tablespoons of shredded mozzarella cheese.
4. Arrange the Italian sausage sandwiches on a baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven.
5. Broil the sandwiches for 4-5 minutes or until the bread is lightly toasted and the cheese is melted. Do not step away from the oven; keep an eye on the sandwiches so they don’t burn.
6. Garnish with chopped parsley if desired.
