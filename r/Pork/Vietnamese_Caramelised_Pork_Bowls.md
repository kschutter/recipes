# Vietnamese Caramelised Pork Bowls

######  Yield: 4 servings
######  Time:  20 minutes

##  *Ingredients*
- 1 1/2 tablespoon cooking oil (peanut/sesame oil)
<!--  -->
- 1/2 onion (finely diced) (~1/2 cup)
- 2 teaspoons ginger (grated or minced)
- 2 garlic cloves (minced)
<!--  -->
- 1 pound ground pork (Note 2)
- 5 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
<!--  -->
- 1 green onion (finely sliced)
- Rice
- Sliced red chilli, tomato, cucumber, carrot strips (optional)

##  *Directions*
1. Start the rice.

2. Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat.

3. Add the onion, ginger, and garlic and cook for 2 minutes.

4. Add the pork mince and cook for 2 minutes or so until white all over, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon.

5. Add the sugar and fish sauce. Stir, then leave it to cook without touching until all the juices cook out and the pork starts caramelised - about 2 minutes. Then stir it and leave it again, without stirring, for around 30 seconds to get more caramelisation. Repeat twice more until caramelised to your taste.

6. Serve over rice, garnished with sliced scallions/shallots.
