# Pork Chops with Bok Choy

######  Yield: 4 servings
######  Time:  30 minutes

##  *Ingredients*
- 1 package (6 to 8 ounces) rice noodles
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
- 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes
<!---->
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 4 boneless center-cut pork chops (about 6 ounces each)
<!---->
- 1 large bok choy (about 2 pounds) (trimmed, cut crosswise into 1-inch strips, and washed (with some water still clinging to leaves))
- 4 scallions (thinly sliced, white and green parts separated)
- 4 cloves garlic (sliced)
- 1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger (peeled and minced)

##  *Directions*
1. In a large bowl of hot tap water, soak noodles until soft, 10 to 15 minutes; drain and set aside. Meanwhile, make sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, sesame oil, and red-pepper flakes; set aside.
2. In a large skillet with a lid, heat oil over medium-high. Season pork chops with salt and pepper. Place in skillet, and cook, turning once, until opaque throughout, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer chops to a plate; loosely cover with aluminum foil, and set aside.
3. To skillet, add bok choy, scallion whites, garlic, and ginger. Cover and cook, tossing occasionally, until bok choy stems are crisp-tender, 4 to 5 minutes.
4. Add noodles and sauce from step 1. Cook, tossing gently, until noodles are heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
5. Thinly slice pork chops. Serve on top of noodles, and sprinkle with scallion greens.
