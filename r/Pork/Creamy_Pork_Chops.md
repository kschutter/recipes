<!---->
- 2 10 oz. cans condensed cream of mushroom soup
- 1 12 oz. can evaporated milk
- 3/4 C. water
- 3 tablespoons onion soup base (1 package of Lipton onion soup is a little over 2 T. so just use that if you'd rather not have a package open.  I buy mine in bulk so it's easier for measuring)
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
<!---->
- fried onions

##  *Directions*

1. Grease a 9x13 baking dish.  place sliced potatoes in the bottom and set the pork chops evenly spaced on top of them.

2. Mix together the soup, milk, water, onion soup, and salt and pepper.  Pour over the pork chops and potatoes.   Sprinkle a few handfuls of the French's Fried Onions over the top.  Cover with foil and bake at 325 for 2- 2 1/2 hours.
