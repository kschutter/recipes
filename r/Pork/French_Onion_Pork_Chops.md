# French Onion Pork Chops

######  Yield: 4 servings
######  Time: 50 minutes

##  *Ingredients*

- 4 boneless pork chops
- 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 2 tablespoon olive oil, divided
<!---->
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 4-5 large sweet onions, sliced
- 1 teaspoon salt, plus additional to season the chops
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper, plus additional to season the chops
<!---->
- 1/4 cup dry red or white wine
- 7 - 8 sprigs fresh thyme plus additional for garnish
- 1/2 cup beef or chicken stock
<!---->
- 4 ounces shredded Swiss or Gruyere cheese

##  *Directions*

1. Brush the Dijon mustard evenly on both sides of the pork chops.

2. Season each chop, on both sides, with salt and pepper.

3. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to a large skillet over medium/high heat and brown the chops on both sides, (approximately 2-3 minutes per side).

4. Remove the browned chops to a plate and keep warm.

5. In the same skillet add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil, the butter, and the sliced onions, stirring well to coat the onions in the oil. Add 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.

6. Cook the onions, stirring only occasionally, until they're golden brown and caramelized. This should take at least 15 minutes over medium/high heat.

7. Add the wine, stock, and fresh thyme to the onions, making sure to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.

8. Cook an additional 2-3 minutes after the addition of the wine and stock, stirring frequently.

9. Reduce the heat to medium and add the chops back into the skillet along with the onions.

10. Cover the skillet and cook for approximately 20-25 minutes, or until the chops are no longer pink in the center.

11. Remove the cover and add the shredded cheese to the top of each chop.

12. Return the cover to the skillet. Turn off the heat, and allow the cheese to melt.

13. Garnish the top of each chop with a sprig or two of fresh thyme.

14. Serve the chops on a bed of caramelized onions, making sure to remove the older thyme sprigs before serving.
