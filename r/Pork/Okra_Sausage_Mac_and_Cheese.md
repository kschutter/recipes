- 8 ounces Gruyère cheese (shredded, divided)

##  *Directions*
1. Preheat oven to 350F with oven rack about 10 inches from heat. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high. Stir in pasta; cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9 to 11 minutes. Drain pasta, and transfer to a large bowl.

2. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large, deep skillet over high until shimmering. Add okra, and cook, stirring occasionally, until bright green, about 3 minutes. Stir okra into cooked pasta. 

3. Place skillet over medium-high, and add remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Add sausage; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sausage to pasta mixture. 

4. Discard all but 1 tablespoon drippings from skillet. Add onion to reserved drippings in skillet; cook over medium-high, stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes, adding garlic during final 1 minute of cook time. Remove from heat. Transfer onion mixture to pasta mixture; stir to combine. Wipe skillet clean.

5. Melt butter in reserved skillet over medium. Sprinkle with flour; cook, whisking constantly, until flour mixture is blond in color, 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually add evaporated milk, whisking constantly, and bring to a simmer over medium. Simmer, whisking constantly, until mixture has thickened and lightly coats the back of a spoon, 1 to 2 minutes. 

6. Reduce heat to low. Whisk in Creole seasoning, dry mustard, and ground white pepper. Whisk in 1 cup white cheddar cheese and 1 cup Gruyère cheese until smooth and melted, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Pour sauce over pasta mixture, and stir to combine.

7. Lightly grease a 13x9-inch broiler-safe baking dish with butter. Pour half of pasta mixture into baking dish, and spread in an even layer. Sprinkle evenly with remaining 1 cup cheddar and remaining 1 cup Gruyère. Top evenly with remaining pasta mixture, and spread in an even layer. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.

8. Bake 25 to 30 minutes. Remove baking dish from oven. Increase oven temperature to broil. Uncover baking dish, and immediately return to oven. Broil mac and cheese until top is browned in spots, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes. Garnish with parsley and scallions. 

### To make ahead
Mac and cheese can be prepared through step 7 and refrigerated for up to 1 day. Let stand at room temperature while oven preheats, about 30 minutes. Proceed with step 8, increasing bake time to 30 to 35 minutes.
