##  *Directions*
1. With a meat mallet pound the pork chops between two pieces of wax paper until they are 1/4 inch thick. Lightly season with salt and pepper on both sides.

3. Meanwhile, place the flour, with 1 teaspoon salt, the eggs and the bread crumbs into 3 bowls. Dip the pork into the flour, then the egg and then the bread crumbs and immediately fry. Do three at a time and then repeat. Turning to brown on both sides, about 3-4 min per side. Drain on a paper towel lined plate and salt. Serve immediately with lemon wedges and parsley.
