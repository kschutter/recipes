# Sausage Pasta Skillet

######  Yield: 4-6 servings
######  Time:  20 minutes

##  *Ingredients*
- 1 pound penne pasta
<!--  -->
- 1 package italian sausage
<!--  -->
- 1 small red onion (sliced)
- 2 teaspoons fennel seeds (optional, crushed)
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed chili pepper flakes
- 1 teaspoon italian seasoning
<!--  -->
- 4 cloves garlic (minced)
- 2 tablespoons crushed tomato
<!--  -->
- 1 red bell pepper (sliced)
- 4 large ripe tomatoes (diced)
<!--  -->
- 1/2 cup vegetable or chicken broth
- Salt and pepper to taste
<!--  -->
- 1 scallion (for garnish)
- Fresh basil (for garnish)

##  *Directions*
1. Cook pasta according to package instructions, until al dente. Drain and set aside.
2. Heat a bit of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sausages and cook until browned on all sides. You can add some water so they don't blacken and stick to the pan. Remove from pan and set aside.
3. In the same skillet (remove water but keep the brown bits), add 1 tablespoon oil and saute onions with crushed fennel seeds, chili pepper flakes, italian seasoning. After mixing well, add the garlic and ground tomato and continue to saute for a couple of minutes, stirring constantly.
4. Add bell pepper and diced tomatoes and cook until vegetables are crisp-tender. Stir in broth and cook for another minute or so. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
5. Add sliced sausage back to the skillet. Cook for 5-10 minutes, until sausage is cooked through and sauce is thickened.
6. Add pasta to the skillet and reheat for a couple of minutes, stirring gently to coat the pasta with the sauce. Garnish with basil, scallions, and parmesan cheese, and serve.
