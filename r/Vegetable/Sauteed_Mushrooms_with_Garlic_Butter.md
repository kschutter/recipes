# Sauteed Mushrooms with Garlic Butter

######  Yield: 6 servings
######  Time:  15 minutes

##  *Ingredients*
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 16 ounces white mushrooms (washed and cut in half)
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
<!--  -->
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2-4 garlic cloves (minced)
<!--  -->
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

##  *Directions*
1. In a large saut√© pan (you want the mushrooms to fit in a single layer), heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat all mushrooms with the oil and then spread them into a single layer.

2. Cook for four minutes on medium-high heat without stirring. Stir and cook for 2 more minutes without stirring.

3. Reduce heat to medium-low and add butter and garlic. Cook for 3-4 more minutes, stirring frequently, until mushrooms are fully cooked, butter is melted, and garlic is fragrant.

4. Remove from heat, stir in parsley and serve immediately.
