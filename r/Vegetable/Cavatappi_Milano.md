# Cavatappi Milano

######  Yield: 4 servings
######  Time:  40 minutes

##  *Ingredients*
- 2 bell peppers
- Olive oil
- 8 ounces fresh mozzarella
<!--  -->
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
- 12 ounces cavatappi pasta
<!--  -->
- 28 ounces marinara sauce
- 1 ounce basil
- Chili flakes
- Salt
<!--  -->
- 4 tablespoons cream cheese
- Pepper

##  *Directions*
1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 400F. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry all produce. Halve bell peppers lengthwise; remove stem and seeds. Pick basil leaves from stems; roughly chop or tear leaves. Tear mozzarella into bite-size pieces.

2. Toss bell pepper halves on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil each; season with salt and pepper. Arrange cut sides down. Roast until softened and lightly charred, 20-25 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool slightly. Transfer to a cutting board, then thinly slice. Heat broiler to high.

3. While bell pepper roasts, add butter to a small microwave-safe bowl; microwave until just melted, 30 seconds. Stir in breadcrumbs and salt.

4. Once water is boiling, add pasta to pot. Cook until al dente, 9-11 minutes. Drain and set aside.

5. While pasta cooks, heat a large, preferably ovenproof, pan over medium-high heat. Add marinara, 1/2 cup water, half the basil, a pinch of chili flakes, and a big pinch of salt; stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium. Simmer until slightly thickened, 3-5 minutes. • Turn off heat and stir in cream cheese until melted. Season with salt and pepper.

6. Stir sliced bell pepper and cavatappi into sauce. If needed, add more water a splash at a time until pasta is thoroughly coated in sauce. Season with salt and pepper. If your pan isn’t ovenproof, transfer mixture to a baking dish. Sprinkle with mozzarella and panko. Broil on top rack until cheese has melted and panko is golden brown, 2-4 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining basil and more chili flakes if desired. Serve.
