# Healthy Slow-Cooker Potato Soup

######  Yield: 4 servings
######  Time:  10 minutes prep, 4 hours 10 minutes total

##  *Ingredients*
#### Potato Soup
- 5 cups vegetable broth (divided)
- 2 pounds white potatoes (peeled and roughly chopped)
- 1 medium white onion (diced)
<!--  -->
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup flour

#### Roasted Chickpeas
- 15 ounce can chickpeas (drained and pat dry)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons sriracha
- 1 teaspoon maple syrup
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper

#### Garnish
- Green onions
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- Plain Greek yogurt

##  *Directions*
1. Preheat oven to 400F.
2. Add 4 cups of the broth, potato, and onion to a slow cooker. Cook on high for 3 to 4 hours, or on low for 6 to 8 (until potatoes are fork-tender).
3. Gently combine all of the Roasted Chickpeas ingredients and spread onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes, or until slightly crispy.
4. When potatoes are finished cooking, melt butter to a large skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook, whisking often, until flour begins to tan slightly (about 5 minutes). 
5. Whisk in remaining 1 cup of broth. Add this mixture into the crockpot of potatoes to thicken it. Stir in cheddar and season with salt and pepper to taste. Top with roasted chickpeas, a dollop of plain Greek yogurt, cheddar, and sliced green onions.
