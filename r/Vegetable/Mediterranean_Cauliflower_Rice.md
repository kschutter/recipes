# Mediterranean Cauliflower Rice

######  Yield: 4 servings
######  Time:  35 minutes

##  *Ingredients*
- 16 ounces store-bought cauliflower rice
- 1/2 cup sliced almonds
<!--  -->
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic (pressed or minced)
<!--  -->
- Pinch of red pepper flakes (omit if sensitive to spice)
- 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
<!--  -->
- 1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

##  *Directions*
1. Wrap the cauliflower rice in a clean tea towel, paper towels, or cheese cloth, twist, and squeeze as much water as possible from the rice—you might be surprised by how much water you can wring out.

2. Toast the almonds in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently (careful, or they’ll burn), until they’re fragrant and starting to turn golden on the edges, about 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the toasted almonds to a bowl to cool.

3. Return the skillet to the heat and add the olive oil and garlic. Cook while stirring until the garlic is fragrant, about 10 to 20 seconds. Add the cauliflower rice, red pepper flakes and salt, and stir to combine. Cook, stirring just every minute or so, until the cauliflower rice is hot and turning golden in places, about 6 to 10 minutes.

4. Remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the toasted almonds, parsley and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve warm.
