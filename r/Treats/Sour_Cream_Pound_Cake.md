# Sour Cream Pound Cake

######  Yield: 12 servings
######  Time:  10 minutes prep, 1 hour 15 minutes total

##  *Ingredients*
- 1 cup butter, room temperature
- 3 cups granulated sugar
<!--  -->
- 6 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
<!--  -->
- 3 cups all purpose flour
- 1 cup sour cream

##  *Directions*
1. Preheat oven to 325F. Coat a 10 cup bundt pan with baking spray. Set aside.

2. In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment mix together the butter and the sugar for 5 minutes on medium speed.

3. Add in the eggs, vanilla, baking soda, and salt and mix until combined, scraping the sides of the bowl as necessary.

4. Turn the mixer to low and add in the flour, mixing until just combined. Add in the sour cream and mix on low for 1 minute until incorporated, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure everything is mixed evenly.

5. Pour batter into the prepared pan and bake for 65-75 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

6. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 20 minutes. Loosen the sides of the cake by running a butter knife around the edges. Invert the bundt pan onto a cake or serving plate. Dust with powdered sugar if desired.
