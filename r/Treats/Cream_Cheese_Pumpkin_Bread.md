# Cream Cheese Pumpkin Bread

######  Time:  10 minutes prep, 55 minutes total

##  *Ingredients*
#### Pumpkin Bread
- 1 2/3 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 pinch salt
<!--  -->
- 1 cup pumpkin puree
- 1/2 cup light brown sugar packed
- 1/4 cup sour cream
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 large egg
#### Cream Cheese Filling
- 8 ounces cream cheese (softened)
- 3/4 cup powder sugar

##  *Directions*
1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Spray a 9x5 bread loaf pan with non-stick baking spray. Set aside.

2. In a large bowl, sift together flour, sugar, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, baking powder, and salt until combined. Set aside.

3. In another bowl, whisk pumpkin puree, brown sugar, sour cream, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and egg until smooth.

4. Pour the sifted dry ingredients in with the wet, using a spatula to gently toss and stir, being sure to scrape the sides of the bowl. Mix until just combined and dry ingredients are no longer visible. Do not over-mix.

5. In a bowl, with an electric mixer, mix softened cream cheese and powder sugar until well combined, and smooth.

6. Pour 1/2 of the pumpkin batter into the prepared bread pan, spread evenly across bottom of the pan with a spatula.

7. Next, pour the cream cheese filling into the pan, smoothing out the filing with a spatula. Do not worry about pressing into corners. The cream cheese will spread out once heated.

8. Lastly, pour the remaining pumpkin batter on top of the filling and spread to cover the sides and corners, careful not to disturb the cream cheese layer beneath. Be sure to completely cover the cream cheese layer.

9. Bake bread for 50-65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.

10. Allow baked cream cheese pumpkin bread cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then transfer to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.

11. Slice pumpkin bread and serve immediately. Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week in an airtight container.
