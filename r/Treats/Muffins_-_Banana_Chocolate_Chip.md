# Banana Chocolate Chip Muffins

######  Yield: 
######  Time:  

##  *Ingredients*
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup golden brown sugar
- 3/4 cup unsalted butter (melted)
<!--  -->
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 eggs
<!--  -->
- 4 ripe bananas (medium-sized)
<!--  -->
- 1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
<!--  -->
- 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 cup walnuts (chopped)

##  *Directions*
1. Preheat oven to 350F.
2. In a large mixing bowl, add 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 1/2 cup golden brown sugar, and 3/4 cup of unsalted melted butter. Use an electric hand mixer to combine everything together for about 1 minute on medium-low speed.
3. Then add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract along with 2 large eggs and mix them in on medium speed.
4. Now in a separate bowl, mash up 4 ripe bananas. Then add them to the muffin batter.
5. Then sift the dry ingredients in this order: 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mix the dry ingredients into the banana muffin batter.
6. Lastly, add 1 cup of chopped walnuts and 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips. Fold them in with a spatula.
7. Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners and fill each muffin full. You should get about 12-13 full muffins out of this recipe.
8. Now top the muffins with extra chocolate chips and bake at 350F for 20-24 minutes.

##  *Notes*
- Sift the dry ingredients - This helps them combine thoroughly with the wet ingredients and avoids clumps of flour that will taste bad in your muffin when they cook.
- Ripen the bananas yourself - Place unripe bananas on a baking sheet in the oven and bake for 15 minutes at 350 degrees. Let them cool before using them.
- Use cupcake liners - This saves a lot of mess when you’re baking them as the melted chocolate can ooze out. They’re also easier to store when in paper liners.
