# Meatball Subs

######  Yield: 6 servings
######  Time:  30 minute prep, 1 hour cook; 1 hour 30 minutes total

##  *Ingredients*
### Meatballs
- 1 cup breadcrumbs
- 1 cup parmesean cheese (freshly grated)
- 4 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1/4 cup flat leaf parsley (finely chopped)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
<!--  -->
- 1/2 cup milk
- 2 large eggs
<!--  -->
- 1 pound ground beef (80/20)
- 1 pound ground pork
- 1/4 cup olive oil
### Subs
- 4 cups marinara sauce
- 6 hoagie rolls (about 8 inches long)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 6 slices provolone cheese (halved)
- 1/3 cup parmesean cheese
- 1/4 cup chopped parsley

##  *Directions*
1. Stir together the breadcrumbs, parmesan, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper in a large mixing bowl. Stir in milk and eggs until mixture is a loose, paste-like consistency. Add beef and pork. Using your hand to gently mix the meat with the breadcrumb mixture until well combined.
2. Divide the meat mixture into 2-ounce portions and gently shape into balls about 2 inches wide. (If the mixture is sticking to your hands, lightly grease your hands with olive oil to prevent sticking.)
3. Heat a large Dutch oven or wide saut√© pan over medium heat; add the olive oil. Working in batches of 6 to 8, brown the meatballs on all sides, about 1 minute per side, turning each meatball about 4 times. Remove from the heat and drain the grease from the pot.
4. Return the Dutch oven to low heat and add the marinara sauce.
5. Nestle the meatballs into the pasta sauce without stirring. Cover and cook 30 minutes.
6. Gently stir the meatballs, making sure each one is coated in sauce. Cover and cook 15 minutes more, or until the meatballs reach an internal temperature of 165F.
7. Preheat oven to broil.
8. Slice the hoagie rolls lengthwise through the center. Hollow out about 1 inch of the inside of the bottom halves of the rolls.
9. Brush the insides of the bread with the olive oil and place, cut-side up, on a rimmed baking sheet. Broil until the bread is toasted, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the top halves of the hoagie rolls from the baking sheet and set aside.
10. Add 3 to 4 meatballs to each of the bottom halves of the rolls; top with 2 pieces of provolone cheese. Broil until the cheese is melted and browned, 1 to 2 minutes.
11. Add more sauce to each sandwich if desired. Sprinkle each sub with parmesan cheese and parsley. Top with the remaining hoagie roll halves. Serve immediately.
