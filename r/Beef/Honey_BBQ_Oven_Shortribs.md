# Honey BBQ Oven Short Ribs

###### Yield:  4-6 servings
###### Time:   5 hrs 5 minutes

##   *Ingredients*
- 1/4 cup sweet paprika
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons dry oregano
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 6 pounds short-ribs, flanken-cut (about 6 ribs bone-in, cut into 5 to 6-inch strips)
- 1/2 cup honey

##      *Directions*
1. Heat the oven to 300 degrees F.

2. In a small bowl, combine the paprika, onion powder, 4 teaspoons salt, oregano, garlic powder, cumin, 
    cayenne pepper and a few grinds of black pepper. Rub the mixture all over the ribs and allow it to 
    sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours at the most.

3. Place the ribs snugly in an oven dish with the fat side of each rib facing up. Cover tightly with 
    aluminum foil and don't be afraid to top the dish with another heavy dish to ensure the seal! 
    Cook in the oven for 2 1/2 hours, at this point the meat should be falling off the bones. 
    Remove the ribs from the oven and raise the temperature to 425 degrees F.

4. Using a pair of tongs, flip and move the beef around a bit. Drizzle the honey evenly over 
    the top of each rib. Place the ribs back in the oven, this time leaving it uncovered and 
    cook another 10 to 15 minutes.
