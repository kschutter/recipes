# Pork Sliders with Smashed Avacados

######  Yield: 8 sliders
######  Time: 30 minutes

##  *Ingredients*
- 8 slider buns
- 12 ounces extra-lean ground pork
- 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese
- 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 ripe peeled avocado
- 2 small ripe tomatoes, sliced
- 8 small lettuce leaves
##  *Directions*
1. Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Lightly coat cut sides of buns with cooking spray. Place buns, cut sides down, in pan; cook 1 minute or until lightly toasted.
2. Combine pork, parsley, salt, and garlic powder in a medium bowl, gently mixing with hands. Divide mixture into 8 equal portions, shaping each into a 1/4-inch-thick patty.
3. Lightly coat both sides of patties with cooking spray. Arrange patties in pan coated with cooking spray; cook 2 minutes. Turn patties over; top patties evenly with cheese. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until cheese melts.
4. Combine lemon juice and avocado in a bowl; mash avocado with a fork, and stir to combine. Spread avocado mixture evenly over bottom halves of buns.
5. Place 1 patty on each bottom bun. Top each with 1 tomato slice and 1 lettuce leaf. Top with top halves of buns. Serve immediately.
