# Shepherds Pie

######  Yield: 4 servings
######  Time: 1 hour 5 minutes

##  *Ingredients*

- 2 lbs potatoes, peeled and quartered
- 8 tablespoons butter (1 stick)
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1-2 cups vegetables - diced carrots, onions, peas
- 1 1/2 lbs ground beef
- 1/2 cup beef broth
- 1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce
- salt, pepper, other seasonings of choice 

##  *Directions*

1. Place the potatoes in medium pot, cover with at least an inch of cold water.
Add a teaspoon of salt, bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until tender 
(about 20 minutes)

2. Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large saute pan on medium heat. 
Add the chopped onions and cook until tender, about 6 to 10 minutes.

  * If you are including vegetables, add them according to their cooking time. 
Carrots should be cooked with the onions, because they take the same time to cook.
  * If you are including peas or corn, add them toward the end of the cooking of the onions, 
or after the meat starts to cook, as they take very little time.

3. Add ground beef to the pan with the vegetables. Cook until no longer pink. 
Season with salt and pepper

4. Add the Worcestershire sauce and beef broth, bring the broth to a simmer and reduce heat to low. 
Cook uncovered for 10 minutes, adding more beef broth if necessary to keep the meat from drying out.

5. When the potatoes are done cooking, place them in a bowl with remaining 4 tablespoons 
of butter, mash and season with salt and pepper to taste.

6. Preheat oven to 400F. Spread the beef, onions and vegetables in an even layer 
in a large baking dish (8x13 casserole).

7. Spread the mashed potatoes over the top of the ground beef. Rough up the surface 
of the potatoes with a fork so there are peaks that get well browned.

8. Place dish on cookie sheet and bake until browned and bubbles, about 30 minutes. 
If necessary, broil for the last few minutes to help brown.

##  *Suggested variations*

- Put a layer of creamed corn between the ground beef and the mashed potatoes.

- Sprinkle grated cheddar cheese over the top of the potatoes before baking.
