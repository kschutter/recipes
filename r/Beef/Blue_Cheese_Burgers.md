##  *Directions*
1. Gently mix all ingredients.
2. Shape into patties, about 1/2 inch thick and larger than your bun. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes or until you are ready to cook.
3. Oil the grill or pan with a paper towel soaked in vegetable oil. Heat the grill or pan to medium-high heat.
4. Season the patties with salt and pepper. Grill or pan-fry the burgers until cooked through, about 4-5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Do not press down on the burgers while cooking.
5. While the burgers are cooking, toast the buns, on the grill or in a toaster.
