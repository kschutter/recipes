# Garlic Butter Brazilian Steak

######  Yield: 4 servings
######  Time:  20 minutes

##  *Ingredients*
- 6 medium cloves garlic
- Kosher salt
<!--  -->
- 1.5 pounds skirt steak trimmed and cut into 4 pieces
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons canola oil or vegetable oil
<!--  -->
- 2 ounces unsalted butter (4 tablespoons)
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

##  *Directions*
1. Peel the garlic cloves and smash them with the side of a chefâ€™s knife. Sprinkle the garlic lightly with salt and mince it.
2. Pat the steak dry and season generously on both sides with salt and pepper. In a heavy-duty 12-inch skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering hot. Add the steak and brown well on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side for medium rare. Transfer the steak to a plate and let rest while you make the garlic butter.
3. In an 8-inch skillet, melt the butter over low heat. Add the garlic and cook, swirling the pan frequently, until lightly golden, about 4 minutes. Lightly salt to taste.
4. Slice the steak, if you like, and transfer to 4 plates. Spoon the garlic butter over the steak, sprinkle with the parsley, and serve.
