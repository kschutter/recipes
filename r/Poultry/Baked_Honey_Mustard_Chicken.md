######  Yield: 2 servings
######  Time:  1 hour

##  *Ingredients*
- 1/2 tablespoon oil (or butter)
- 2 chicken breasts
- 1/4 teaspoon paprika
<!--  -->
- 1 tablespoon wholegrain mustard
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon dijon mustard
<!--  -->
- Juice from 1/2 lemon

##  *Directions*
1. Preheat the oven to 400F.

2. Grease an oven-proof dish with the oil or butter and place the chicken in there.

3. Season well with salt, pepper and paprika.

4. In a small bowl, combine the dijon mustard, wholegrain mustard and honey.

5. Pour the mixture over the chicken breasts and bake in the oven for about 30-45 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken.

6. You may add 1-2 tablespoons of water in the pan if needed to prevent the edges of the dish from browning if there is not much chicken juice released during cooking.

7. Once the chicken is cooked through, squeeze lemon juice over and serve with broccoli spears.
