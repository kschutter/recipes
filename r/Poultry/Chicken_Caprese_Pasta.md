# Chicken Caprese Pasta

######  Yield: 8 servings
######  Time:  1 hour

##  *Ingredients*

- 2 cups cooked chicken (diced)
- 1 3/4 cups halved grape tomatoes (can substitute with a can of undrained diced tomatoes)
- 12 ounces (about 3 cups) uncooked uncooked penne pasta
- 3 1/2 cups chicken broth
- 1/2 cup chopped or torn fresh basil leaves (divided)
- 2 teaspoons garlic (minced)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 8 ounces (about 2 cups) shredded mozzarella cheese (divided)

##  *Directions*
1. Preheat oven to 425F. Spray a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. In the prepared dish (or in a separate bowl), stir all ingredients save 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.
3. Cover the dish tightly with foil and bake for 40 minutes.
4. Uncover; stir. At this point you should check the pasta to make sure that it is al dente (firm but just about finished cooking). If itâ€™s still too hard, cover the dish and return to the oven until pasta is al dente.
5. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella over the top. Bake uncovered for 5-10 more minutes (or until cheese is melted and pasta is tender).
6. Garnish with remaining basil leaves just before serving.
