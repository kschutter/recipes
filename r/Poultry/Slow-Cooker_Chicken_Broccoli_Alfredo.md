4. Toss the chicken and sauce together in the slow cooker, and cook on LOW for 2 hours.
5. One hour before the cooker finishes, preheat oven to 425 F.
6. Season the broccoli with salt, pepper, and paprika. Toss it on a lightly greased baking pan and roast in the oven for 30-35 minutes.
7. Put pot of water for the noodles on the stove, adding them when it begins to boil, and take them off before they are completely done (about 7-8 minutes.)
8. When slow cooker is finished, remove and shred the chicken, then add the chicken, the broccoli, the undercooked pasta, the parmesan, and a mixture of the corstarch + 1 teaspoon of water, back to the cooker. Cook on HIGH for 30 minutes or until pasta is tender.
