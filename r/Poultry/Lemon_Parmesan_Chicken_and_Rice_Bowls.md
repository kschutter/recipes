######  Yield: 5 servings
######  Time:  40 minutes

##  *Ingredients*
- 1 cup rice
- 5 tablespoons vegetable oil (divided)
<!--  -->
- 1 (8 ounce) package frozen broccoli
<!--  -->
- 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast (cut into 1-inch cubes)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 1â€‰1/2 teaspoons onion powder
<!--  -->
- 1 large onion (diced)
<!--  -->
1 lemon (zested and juiced)
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

##  *Directions*
1. Preheat oven to 400F.

2. Heat an oven-safe pot over medium-high heat; stir rice and 2 tablespoons oil together in the hot saucepan to coat the rice with oil. Pour hot water over the rice; bring to a boil and place a cover on the pot.

3. Bake rice in preheated oven until the water is absorbed and rice is tender, 12 to 15 minutes.

4. Place broccoli into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and season broccoli with salt and pepper.

5. Heat remaining oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; add chicken to hot oil, season with garlic powder and onion powder. Saute chicken until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes.

6. Stir onion into the chicken; continue cooking until onions are soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.

7. Spoon rice into the skillet; cook until lightly browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Stir broccoli into the rice mixture; sprinkle lemon zest and lemon juice over the mixture and stir. Top with Parmesan cheese.
