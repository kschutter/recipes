# Stuffed Portabello Mushrooms

######  Yield: 4 servings
######  Time:  Prep time: 15 minutes, total: 50 minutes

##  *Ingredients*
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 medium portabello mushrooms (stems removed)
- 2 cups chicken
<!--  -->
- 1/2 red bell pepper (diced)
- 1/2 red onion (diced)
- 1 egg
- 1/4 cup bread crumbs
- 2 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley (chopped)
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (divided)

##  *Directions*
1. Preheat oven to 400F. Grease a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Drizzle olive oil over chicken and season with salt and pepper. Bake for 15 minutes until chicken is just barely cooked through. Remove from oven and let cool slightly before dicing or shredding into small pieces.
2. While chicken is cooking, de-stem and scrape out the portobellos, reserving inside mushroom gills and disposing of stems.
3. In a large bowl, combine mushroom gills, chicken, red pepper, red onion, egg, bread crumbs, garlic, salt, pepper, parsley, and half the cheddar cheese. Stir until well combined. Change the oven temperature to 375F.
4. Divide the mixture evenly between the four portobello mushrooms. Top with remaining cheddar cheese. Bake for 20 minutes until cheese is melted and mushrooms are tender. Serve immediately.
