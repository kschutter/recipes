# Guacamole Stuffed Chicken Breast

######  Yield: 4 servings
######  Time:  1 hour

##  *Ingredients*
- 4 small boneless skinless chicken breasts
- 1 cup guacamole
- 2 large eggs
<!--  -->
- 1 cup plain panko breadcrumbs
- 2 teaspoons lime zest
- 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
- 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper

##  *Directions*
1. Preheat oven to 400F.

2. Use a mallet to pound each chicken breast thin and flat. Set aside.

3. Divide the guacamole between the chicken pieces and spread it into a thin layer. Roll up the chicken, starting with the skinniest edge (the part that comes to a point). Secure the seam with toothpicks.

4. In a shallow bowl, whisk the eggs.

5. In a separate shallow bowl, add the breadcrumbs, lime zest, garlic powder, chili powder, cumin, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and the pepper. Stir to combine.

6. Roll the stuffed chicken in the eggs. Let the excess egg drip off. Press and roll the chicken in the breadcrumbs. Shake off the excess breadcrumbs. Place the chicken seam-side down in a baking dish that has been sprayed with cooking spray. Discard the remaining egg and breadcrumbs.

7. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and itâ€™s coating is golden brown and crispy.
