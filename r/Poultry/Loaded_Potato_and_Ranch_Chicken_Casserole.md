# Loaded Potato & Ranch Chicken Casserole

######  Yield: 6 servings
######  Time:  1 hour

##  *Ingredients*
- 1 1/2 pounds ukon gold potatoes (diced into 1 inch cubes)
- 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut into 1-inch cubes)
- 1/2 cup prepared ranch dressing (divided)
<!--  -->
- 2 cups Mexican Cheese Blend
- 1 cup (cooked & crumbled) bacon
- 1/2 cup green onion (diced)

##  *Directions*
1. Preheat oven to 425F.
2. Spray a 9x13 baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.
3. In a large bowl mix together the potatoes, salt & pepper and 1/4 cup ranch dressing.
4. Scoop the potatoes into prepared baking dish (save that bowl, we're going to use it again for the chicken.)
5. Bake the potatoes for 30 minutes, until almost thoroughly cooked (they won't be fork tender quite yet.).
6. While the potatoes are cooking, add the cubed chicken to the bowl you used to the potatoes and add salt and pepper and the remaining 1/4 cup ranch seasoning.
7. Once the potatoes have cooked 30 minutes, remove baking dish from the oven and lower the oven temperature to 400F.
8. Top the cooked potatoes with the raw marinated chicken.
9. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
10. Place baking dish back in the oven and cook for an additional 20 minutes (or until chicken is fully cooked.)
11. Take baking dish out of the oven and top with shredded cheese, bacon and green onion.
12. Place back in oven for 8-10 minutes until cheese is melted and bubbly.
