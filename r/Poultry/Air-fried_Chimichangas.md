######  Yield: 
######  Time:  

##  *Ingredients*
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 small yellow onion (chopped)
- 2 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
<!--  -->
- 3/4 cup salsa
- 4 cups chicken (shredded, cooked)
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
<!--  -->
- 1 (15 ounce) can refried beans
- 8 large flour tortillas
- 1 cup shredded cheddar
- 1 cup shredded pepper jack
- 1/2 cup sour cream (plus more for serving)
- Olive oil cooking spray
- Hot sauce and guacamole (for serving)

##  *Directions*
1. In a medium skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add salsa and bring to a simmer, then add chicken and toss to coat; season with salt and black pepper. Remove from heat.
2. Spread about 1/4 cup beans in center of tortillas, then sprinkle with both cheeses. Top with about 1/2 cup of chicken mixture and sour cream. Roll into a burrito by folding top and bottom of tortilla into center, then fold right side over filling, tucking and tightly rolling to seal. Transfer to a plate seam side down.
3. Working in batches, in an air-fryer basket, arrange burritos seam side down; spray with cooking spray. Cook at 400F for 5 minutes, then turn, spray with more cooking spray, and cook 5 minutes more.
4. Divide chimichangas among plates. Drizzle with hot sauce and sour cream. Serve with guacamole alongside.
