# Chicken Peanut Soup

######  Yield: 4 servings
######  Time:  45 minutes

##  *Ingredients*
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 1 1/2 pounds boneless chicken breasts
- 2 red potatoes with skin (cut into small cubes)
<!--  -->
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion (finely chopped)
- 1 red or green chile, with seeds (finely chopped)
- 1/2 green bell pepper, seeded (finely chopped)
<!--  -->
- 1/2 cup chunky peanut butter
- 1 lime
##  *Directions*
1. In a medium pot, cover the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Add the
chicken and potatoes. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat until the
potatoes are tender and the chicken is just cooked through, about 25
minutes.

2. Meanwhile, in a stockpot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add
the onion, chile and bell pepper and cook until softened, about 10
minutes.

3. Remove the chicken breasts from the broth and shred the meat; set
aside.

4. Pour 1/4 of the broth into the stockpot. In a blender, puree the rest
of the broth and all of the potatoes. Pour the mixture into the
stockpot and stir in the peanut butter until combined.  Add the
shredded chicken. Stir in a little water to thin the soup if desired.
Heat gently. Season with salt, pepper and lime juice to taste.
