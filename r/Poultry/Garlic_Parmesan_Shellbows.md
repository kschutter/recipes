# Garlic Parmesan Shellbows

######  Yield: 4 servings
######  Time:  25 minutes

##  *Ingredients*
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 cloves garlic (minced)
<!--  -->
- 2 1/2 cups vegetable or chicken broth
- 1 cup whole milk
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 8 ounces shellbow pasta
<!--  -->
- 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
- 1/4 cup heavy cream

##  *Directions*
1. Melt butter over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant and soft (avoid browning).
2. Add the broth, milk, salt, and pasta. Bring to a boil and then turn the heat down to a low simmer. Let the pasta cook for 15 minutes, until soft and the liquid has reduced. (The milk might form a skin on top of the pot or on the spoon – no worries, just skim it off.)
3. When the sauce is thickened and the pasta is soft, stir in the parmesan and cream.
