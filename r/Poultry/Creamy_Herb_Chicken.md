######  Yield: 4 servings
######  Time: 30 minutes

##  *Ingredients*
- 4 chicken breasts (pounded 1/2-inch thin)
- 2 teaspoons each of onion powder and garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon fresh chopped parsley
- 1/2 teaspoon each of dried thyme and dried rosemary (or basil and oregeno)
- salt and pepper, to season
<!---->
- 3 tablespoon olive oil

- 1 teaspoon fresh chopped parsley
- 1/2 teaspoon each of dried thyme and dried rosemary
<!---->
- 1 cup milk (or half and half)
<!---->
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon water, until smooth

##  *Directions*
1. Coat chicken breasts with the onion and garlic powders and herbs. Season generously with salt and pepper.

2. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan or skillet over medium-high heat and cook chicken breasts until opaque and no longer pink inside (about 5 minutes each side, depending on thickness). Transfer to a plate; set aside.

3. To the same pan or skillet, heat another 2 teaspoons of olive oil and saut√© garlic, with parsley, thyme and rosemary, for about 1 minute, or until fragrant.

4. Stir in milk (or cream); season with salt and pepper, to taste.

5. Bring to a boil; add the cornstarch mixture to the centre of the pan, quickly stirring, until sauce has thickened slightly. Reduce heat and simmer gently for a further minute to allow the sauce to thicken more.

6. Return chicken to the skillet. Sprinkle with extra herbs if desired. Serve immediately.
