#   Cilantro Lime Chicken Bowl

######  Yield:  Makes 2
######  Time:   30 minutes

##  *Ingredients*
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 lime - the zest and juice
- 2 tbsp fresh cilantro - chopped and more for garnish
- 1/4 tsp each: salt and pepper
<!---->
- 2 lbs chicken breast
<!---->
- 1 avocado
- 1 lime - just the juice
- 1 tsp garlic powder
<!---->
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 handful fresh cilantro - chopped

##  *Directions*
1. First make the marinade for your chicken. In a large ziplock, combine your olive oil,
    lime zest and juice, chopped cilantro, salt, and pepper.
2. Then, place your chicken breasts between two sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap and use a 
    meat mallet or rolling pin to flatten your chicken so that the pieces are even in thickness. 
    Then, add your chicken to the ziplock with the marinade and mix everything around so the chicken is 
    fully coated. Place in the fridge to marinate for at least 15 minutes. I let ours marinate for about 
    an hour and it was great!
3. While the chicken is marinating, make your avocado cream. Place all of the avocado cream ingredients 
    in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth and creamy. Start with one tablespoon of water. 
    You may need to add more water to get the consistency thinner depending on the size of avocado used. 
    It should be like a thick and creamy salad dressing.
4. Once the chicken is done marinating, cook it on the grill outside or in a cast iron skillet on the stove.
    Either way, use medium-high heat and grease the grill with more olive oil.
    Place your chicken on the grill or in the pan and cook for about 6 minutes on each side, or until 
    the chicken is cooked all the way through.
5. While the chicken is going, cook your rice. Add your chopped cilantro, and season with olive oil, salt and pepper. It will only take about 5 minutes, so you can
    wait till you flip the chicken to start. Cook your rice over medium heat, stirring occasionally.
    You can also cover your pan to speed up the cooking time as needed.
6. Create a bed of rice, then add your chicken on top, drizzle the avocado cream, and top with fresh cilantro.
