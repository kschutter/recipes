# Honey Lime Chicken

######  Yield: 3 servings
######  Time:  25 minutes

##  *Ingredients*
- 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts
- 2 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1 heaping tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- Pinch of cayenne pepper
- Pinch of salt
<!--  -->
- fresh parsley (chopped)
- lime wedges

##  *Directions*
1. Preheat the oven to 400F.

2. Combine the chicken breasts with garlic, honey, soy sauce, lime juice, cayenne pepper and salt. (You may double the marinade if you want it to be more "saucy"). Stir to combine well. Transfer the chicken and the honey mixture to a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.

3. Cover the chicken with aluminum foil to prevent burning.

4. Bake the chicken for 20 minutes, or until cooked. If the sauce pools at the bottom of the foil, spoon and brush the sauce over the chicken. Broil the chicken for 1 minute or until the chicken skin is charred. Remove from heat, garnish with parsley and serve immediately with some lime wedges.
