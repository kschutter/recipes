######  Time:  1 hour

##  *Ingredients*
- 2 eggs (beaten)
<!--  -->
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese (grated (Fresh is better but use pregrated if necessary))

3. Beat 2 eggs in first bowl.
4. Mix flour, parmesan, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a second bowl.
5. Place a wire rack on a large baking sheet and brush the rack with oil.
6. Dip chicken, 1 breast at a time, in egg mixture, then in parmesan/paprika mixture,
   turning to evenly coat both sides of each breast with each ingredient.
7. Place on prepared baking sheet, in a single layer.
8. Pour the melted butter evenly over the chicken.
9. Bake for about 40-45 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cheese has browned, and the chicken has cooked.
